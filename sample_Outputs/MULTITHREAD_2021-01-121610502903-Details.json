        "Additional Information": "The New York City Board of Correction (BOC) is a nine-person, non-judicial oversight board, which regulates, monitors, and inspects the correctional facilities of the City. Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the Board\u2019s five functions:\n\u2022 Establish and ensure compliance with minimum standards for the care, custody,\ncorrection, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the\njurisdiction of the Department of Correction;\n\u2022 Investigate serious incidents;\n\u2022 Review grievances from people in custody and staff;\n\u2022 Evaluate the performance of the Department of Correction; and,\n\u2022 Make recommendations on areas of key correctional planning.\n\nThe Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules establishing ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the City\u2019s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21 year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. In late 2016, the Board enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the City\u2019s jails.\n\nIn recent years, the Board has nearly doubled its annual budget (currently $3 million) and its staff (currently 27, with planned expansion to 38) to expand its oversight efforts, including bolstered research, rule-making, and monitoring work. With offices in lower Manhattan and Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with the Department of Correction and Health + Hospitals, and often with other government and external partners, on a wide variety of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities. The Board brings to this work a strong emphasis on data-sharing, data-driven decision making and public reporting. In keeping with major reforms occurring at the national, state and local level, the Board recently re-envisioned its mission: to carry out independent oversight and enact regulation in support of safer, fairer, smaller and more humane jails.",

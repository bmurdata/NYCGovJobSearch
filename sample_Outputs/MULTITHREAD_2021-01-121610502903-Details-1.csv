Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the Board’s five functions:
• Establish and ensure compliance with minimum standards for the care, custody,
correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Correction;
• Investigate serious incidents;
• Review grievances from people in custody and staff;
• Evaluate the performance of the Department of Correction; and,
• Make recommendations on areas of key correctional planning.

The Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules establishing ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the City’s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21 year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. In late 2016, the Board enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the City’s jails.

In recent years, the Board has nearly doubled its annual budget (currently $3 million) and its staff (currently 27, with planned expansion to 38) to expand its oversight efforts, including bolstered research, rule-making, and monitoring work. With offices in lower Manhattan and Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with the Department of Correction and Health + Hospitals, and often with other government and external partners, on a wide variety of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities. The Board brings to this work a strong emphasis on data-sharing, data-driven decision making and public reporting. In keeping with major reforms occurring at the national, state and local level, the Board recently re-envisioned its mission: to carry out independent oversight and enact regulation in support of safer, fairer, smaller and more humane jails.","Full-Time, at least 35 hours per week","The Board seeks an enthusiastic, high-energy information technology professional to manage, design, and develop the agency’s IT operations and data management strategies.

CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE IN JOB DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED SKILLS **

AMENED **The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is a world-renowned agency with a long tradition of protecting and promoting health in the nation’s most culturally and linguistically diverse city. Our 7,000-plus team members bring an extraordinary array of languages, cultures and experiences to bear on the work of public health.

The Center for Health Equity and Community Wellness (CHECW) aims to eliminate racial inequities resulting in premature mortality, with a focus on COVID-19 and chronic disease, by addressing the social and environmental factors that impact health. CHECW works to increase placed-based investments in priority neighborhoods with community programming and services based on epidemiology; influence and leverage the health system to promote whole-person care; and intensify the agency’s approach to tackle big salt and sugar, big tobacco, the built environment and other determinants of health and root causes of health inequities. CHECW is comprised of the Bureau of Brooklyn Neighborhood Health, the Bureau of Bronx Neighborhood Health, the Bureau of Harlem Neighborhood Health, the Bureau of Chronic Disease Prevention, the Bureau of Health Equity Capacity Building, the Bureau of Equitable Health Systems and the Bureau of Finance, Administration, and Services.

In addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional health and wellbeing, NYC is experiencing intersecting health crises, including racism and social and economic instability. In recognition of all these stressors, mental health equity remains central in our COVID-19 emergency preparedness and response efforts to effectively meet the needs of the most impacted New Yorkers. As part of its comprehensive, place-based strategy to reduce mental health inequities exacerbated by COVID-19 and in collaboration with New York City’s Crisis Prevention and Response Task Force, DOHMH supports implementation of the Neighborhood Support Networks (NSN). The NSN will provide post-crisis support to individuals hospitalized following a 911 behavioral health crisis. It will operate in East Harlem and north central Bronx. The NSN will drive one of the agency’s three COVID-19 priorities – to address the “parallel pandemics” related to COVID-19, including mental health. It is central in DOHMH’s emergency preparedness and response efforts to COVID-19.


The Bureau of Health Equity Capacity Building is seeking to hire a Program Director for the Neighborhood Support Networks. Under the direction of the Assistant Commissioner, the Program Director will:

• Oversee, develop, plan, and implement two NSNs to respond to COVID-19-exaserbated mental health crises in the 25th (East Harlem) and 47th (Northern Bronx) neighborhood precincts in partnership with Agency, community, and contracted partners.
• Create and effectively manage workplans, evaluation and research plans, reporting tools, goals and objectives, and strategic planning processes for the six-person NSN team to support COVID-19-realted mental health need
• Research and provide guidance on best practices for applying a racial equity and community-informed mental health practice lens to the planning process, implementation process, metrics, and evaluation.
• Supervise two staff (evaluator and program manager/QI specialist) and provide direct oversight, management and coaching for workplan development, project implementation and annual performance evaluation
• Provide oversight and support for the overall project cohesiveness across the NSN, including serving as a neutral convener and facilitator of effective dialogues among stakeholders, including the NSN advisory boards
• Liaise with other city agencies, including Mayor’s Office of Thrive NYC, NYC Health + Hospitals, NYPD, FDNY, and the Department of Homeless Services as a recipient of Crisis Prevention and Response Task Force funding
• Engage and liaise with the Crisis Prevention and Response Task Force steering committee and stakeholders to plan and develop the final program model and metrics for the NSN.
• Oversee contracting and financial processes in partnership with division administration, including distribution of planning funding to community partners and procurement of organizations to manage the NSN
• Review and approve spending plans for NSN budgets and effective use of funding to meet team goals and objectives
• Develop grant and fundraising applications in support of program funding
• Lead program dissemination, including the writing of papers and reports for publication, presenting results and findings to stakeholders internally, locally, and at professional meetings and conferences.

AMENDED  **The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is a world-renowned agency with a long tradition of protecting and promoting health in the nation’s most culturally and linguistically diverse city. Our 7,000-plus team members bring an extraordinary array of languages, cultures and experiences to bear on the work of public health. 

The Center for Health Equity and Community Wellness (CHECW) aims to eliminate racial inequities resulting in premature mortality, with a focus on COVID-19 and chronic disease, by addressing the social and environmental factors that impact health. CHECW works to increase placed-based investments in priority neighborhoods with community programming and services based on epidemiology; influence and leverage the health system to promote whole-person care; and intensify the agency’s approach to tackle big salt and sugar, big tobacco, the built environment and other determinants of health and root causes of health inequities. CHECW is comprised of the Bureau of Brooklyn Neighborhood Health, the Bureau of Bronx Neighborhood Health, the Bureau of Harlem Neighborhood Health, the Bureau of Chronic Disease Prevention, the Bureau of Health Equity Capacity Building, the Bureau of Equitable Health Systems and the Bureau of Finance, Administration, and Services.

Established in 1957, BOC is one of the earliest independent oversight boards of custodial and detention settings in the United States. The Mayor, City Council and presiding justices of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the First and Second Judicial Departments (in joint nomination with the Mayor) appoint its members. The City Charter mandates the Board’s five functions:
• Establish and ensure compliance with minimum standards for the care, custody,
correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all persons held or confined under the
jurisdiction of the Department of Correction;
• Investigate serious incidents;
• Review grievances from people in custody and staff;
• Evaluate the performance of the Department of Correction; and,
• Make recommendations on areas of key correctional planning.

The Board established the Minimum Standards on jail conditions in 1979, on mental health care in 1985, and on health care in 1991. In 2007, BOC finished a comprehensive review of the Minimum Standards and adopted a series of amendments. In 2015-2016, the Board promulgated rules establishing ground-breaking criminal justice reforms. This included the City’s ending of punitive segregation for 16-21 year olds and individuals with serious physical/mental health disabilities. In late 2016, the Board enacted a new chapter of its Minimum Standards that are based on national standards underlying the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). These new rules require action which is specifically tailored to detecting, preventing and responding to sexual abuse and sexual harassment in the City’s jails.

In recent years, the Board has nearly doubled its annual budget (currently $3 million) and its staff (currently 27, with planned expansion to 38) to expand its oversight efforts, including bolstered research, rule-making, and monitoring work. With offices in lower Manhattan and Rikers Island, BOC works regularly with the Department of Correction and Health + Hospitals, and often with other government and external partners, on a wide variety of criminal justice issues germane to its oversight responsibilities. The Board brings to this work a strong emphasis on data-sharing, data-driven decision making and public reporting. In keeping with major reforms occurring at the national, state and local level, the Board recently re-envisioned its mission: to carry out independent oversight and enact regulation in support of safer, fairer, smaller and more humane jails.","Only candidates with a permanent Computer Systems Manager title or candidates that have passed the latest  Computer Systems Manager exam (exam # 9011) will be considered for the position.

"In December 2018, Mayor de Blasio and New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) released NYCHA 2.0, a comprehensive plan to fix and preserve public housing.  NYCHA’s Real Estate Development Department (REDD) is charged with leading and structuring real estate transactions that intend address over $15 billion in capital needs.  REDD primarily utilizes the following three tools to generate the necessary revenue for capital improvements:

1. Permanent Affordability Commitment Together (PACT) – PACT uses U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 programs to fund renovations and convert public housing (Section 9) apartments to permanently affordable housing.  NYCHA is in the process of converting 62,000 apartments over 10 years, which intends to address $12.8 billion of capital needs.

2. Build to Preserve (BTP) – New mixed-income buildings will be constructed on some underutilized spaces across the NYCHA portfolio.  NYCHA expects to address $2 billion in capital need across approximately 10,000 apartments.

3. Transfer to Preserve (TTP) – NYCHA will sell a portion of its estimated 80 million square feet of unused development rights (aka “air rights”) to adjacent privately-owned sites.  TTP will generate $1 billion for capital repairs at adjacent developments.

This is an exciting opportunity to join a small but growing team of real estate professionals, public housing experts, architects, planners, and urban designers to shape meaningful investments in NYCHA’s portfolio that not only address the physical needs of buildings and apartments but also enhance resident health and access to opportunity.

Key Responsibilities:

• Develop and administer housing development programs related to construction that require the formulation and implementation of new procedures and guidelines, such as a Construction Monitoring Program for NYCHA PACT developments and other REDD projects, including development and implementation of progress oversight and quality assurance measures;
• Coordinate construction activities related to the disposition and renovation of NYCHA-owned buildings or land;
• Analyze feasibility of rehabilitation of NYCHA developments;
• Analyze and recommend solutions to construction problems to facilitate completion of work;
• Serve as a technical resource person providing guidance to other staff in the specialized housing areas of construction; resolve complex problems in this area;
• Ensure that affected parties are in compliance with agency construction rules, regulations and guidelines;
• Assist in the preparation and monitoring of contracts and loan agreements associated with REDD housing development projects, including assisting in contract negotiations;
• Research and implement best practices for monitoring and reporting of building renovations;
• Inform scope of work for housing development projects through PACT and other REDD initiatives;
• Attend field meetings and inspections;
• Review and approval of project change orders and requisitions;
• Create and deliver presentations to resident leaders, community stakeholders, elected officials, and NYCHA staff;

"In December 2018, Mayor de Blasio and New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) released NYCHA 2.0, a comprehensive plan to fix and preserve public housing.  NYCHA's Real Estate Development Department (REDD) is charged with leading and structuring real estate transactions that will address over $15 billion in capital needs.  REDD will utilize the following three tools to generate the necessary revenue:

1) Permanent Affordability Commitment Together (PACT) – PACT will use U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 programs to fund renovations and convert public housing (Section 9) apartments to permanently affordable housing.  NYCHA plans to convert 62,000 apartments over 10 years, which will address $12.8 billion of capital needs.

2) Build to Preserve (BTP) – New mixed-income buildings will be constructed on some underutilized spaces across the NYCHA portfolio.  NYCHA expects to address $2 billion in capital need across approximately 10,000 apartments.

3) Transfer to Preserve (TTP) – NYCHA will sell a portion of its estimated 80 million square feet of unused development rights (""air rights"") to adjacent privately-owned sites.  TTP will generate $1 billion for capital repairs at adjacent developments.

Under the direction of the Vice President of Asset Management, the Senior Project Manager will manage a portfolio of assets repositioned for the preservation and creation of public and affordable housing, respectively.

The Senior Project Manager will work on a team with technical knowledge related to real estate development, public housing, architecture, planning, and urban design.  The Senior Project Manager will be responsible for implementing asset management strategies crucial to achieving NYCHA 2.0.  The key responsibilities for this position include, but are not limited to the following:

"In December 2018, Mayor de Blasio and New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) released NYCHA 2.0, a comprehensive plan to fix and preserve public housing.  NYCHA’s Real Estate Development Department (REDD) is charged with leading and structuring real estate transactions that will address over $15 billion in capital needs.  REDD will utilize the following three tools to generate the necessary revenue:

1. Permanent Affordability Commitment Together (PACT) – PACT will use U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 programs to fund renovations and convert public housing (Section 9) apartments to permanently affordable housing.  NYCHA plans to convert 62,000 apartments over 10 years, which will address $12.8 billion of capital needs.

2. Build to Preserve (BTP) – New mixed-income buildings will be constructed on some underutilized spaces across the NYCHA portfolio.  NYCHA expects to address $2 billion in capital need across approximately 10,000 apartments.

3. Transfer to Preserve (TTP) – NYCHA will sell a portion of its estimated 80 million square feet of unused development rights (“air rights”) to adjacent privately-owned sites.  TTP will generate $1 billion for capital repairs at adjacent developments.

Under the supervision of the Director of Community Planning, the Community Planner will lead community-based planning and engagement initiatives focused on the preservation and development of permanently affordable housing.  The Community Planner will conduct research and engage with residents, property managers, community organizations, and elected officials to develop and implement community-driven plans for NYCHA real estate projects.

This is an exciting opportunity to join a small but growing team of real estate professionals, public housing experts, architects, planners, and urban designers to shape meaningful investments in NYCHA’s portfolio that not only address the physical needs of buildings and apartments but also enhance resident health and access to opportunity.

Key Responsibilities:

• Lead community planning processes to develop a vision, goals, and strategies – including physical, programmatic, and policy interventions – for NYCHA 2.0 projects.
• Conduct site, neighborhood, and population analyses to inform strategy development and identify critical opportunities and challenges to implementation.
• Create compelling and accessible public-facing materials to share information and solicit feedback about project proposals.
• Plan and facilitate resident and community meetings and workshops.
• Create and deliver presentations to resident leaders, community stakeholders, elected officials, and NYCHA staff.
• Write and design community planning documents, including community visioning reports, neighborhood plans, project summaries, and studies.
• Collaborate with City, State, and Federal agencies, as well as other NYCHA departments – including Capital Projects, Community Engagement & Partnerships, External Affairs, Operations, and Strategic Planning – to conduct research and develop strategies.
• Work with the REDD project team and development partners to ensure community goals and strategies are appropriately implemented.

"Job Description

In December 2018, Mayor de Blasio and New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) released NYCHA 2.0, a comprehensive plan to fix and preserve public housing.  NYCHA’s Real Estate Development Department (REDD) is charged with leading and structuring real estate transactions that will address over $15 billion in capital needs.  REDD will utilize the following three tools to generate the necessary revenue:

1) Permanent Affordability Commitment Together (PACT) – PACT will use U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8 programs to fund renovations and convert public housing (Section 9) apartments to permanently affordable housing.  NYCHA plans to convert 62,000 apartments over 10 years, which will address $12.8 billion of capital needs.

2) Build to Preserve (BTP) – New mixed-income buildings will be constructed on some underutilized spaces across the NYCHA portfolio.  NYCHA expects to address $2 billion in capital need across approximately 10,000 apartments.

3) Transfer to Preserve (TTP) – NYCHA will sell a portion of its estimated 80 million square feet of unused development rights (“air rights”) to adjacent privately-owned sites.  TTP will generate $1 billion for capital repairs at adjacent developments.

Under the direction of the Senior Vice President for Real Estate, the Project Manager will assist with the financial modeling and analysis of housing development projects on property owned by NYCHA, preservation projects to rehabilitate and preserve NYCHA-owned public housing, and other NYCHA Real Estate Development activities.
In addition to playing an important role in executing NYCHA 2.0, the Project Manager will also work on projects under NYCHA’s 100% Affordable Housing Program.  The program aims to build 10,000 units of affordable housing on underused NYCHA-owned land. The Project Manager will be responsible for projects associated with these programs as well as other departmental initiatives.

The Project Manager will work on a team with technical knowledge related to real estate development, public housing, architecture, planning, and urban design. The Project Manager will work on multiple projects crucial to implementing NYCHA 2.0. The key responsibilities for this position include, but are not limited to:

•Administer multiple real estate transactions.
•Financial analysis and modeling for new construction and preservation projects.
•Review and evaluation of due diligence materials as it relates to project financing, including ground leases, loan documents and appraisals.
•Identify and analyze potential funding sources.

•Representing NYCHA in meetings with inter-agency representatives, development partners, lenders, and residents.
•Draft requests for proposals.

"The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is the City agency responsible for oversight of for-hire transportation in New York City, which comprises six distinct industries:  yellow taxis, community car services, luxury limousines, black cars including app-based dispatch companies such as Uber, Lyft and Via, paratransit vehicles and commuter vans.  Combined, these industries transport more than a million passengers per day.  Our role is to ensure that each passenger’s riding experience is safe, comfortable and convenient. The TLC licenses approximately 200,000 drivers, 130,000 vehicles and over 1000 businesses. In the past six years the agency has been responsible for developing and implementing a regulatory framework for rides prearranged through cellphone apps, which now account for the majority of the trips performed in TLC-regulated vehicles. New York City is unique because it fully regulates these app-based for-hire services, with the companies, their drivers, and the vehicles they operate licensed by the TLC.  The TLC has required the app-based for-hire companies to provide trip, fare and driver income data for every trip; to provide wheelchair-accessible service; to pay drivers a minimum amount per trip and to limit the amount of time that their cars drive without passengers in the most-congested areas of the city.  TLC has also responded to the challenges facing drivers and companies impacted by the rise of app-based for-hire companies, reviewing and updating legacy regulations to reduce regulatory burdens, provide even regulation across the licensed industries, and allow for innovation and competition. 

The Deputy Commissioner for Policy works closely with the Commissioner and other Deputy Commissioners to develop data-driven policy solutions for the agency; assists the Commissioner in overseeing the implementation of high priority initiatives; oversees the investigation and analysis of approximately one-million daily trip records; and plans and coordinates projects and studies relevant to agency operations. The Deputy Commissioner for Policy will oversee 30+ personnel responsible for research and data analysis; technology evaluation and licensing; driver and stakeholder outreach and driver education. The Deputy Commissioner for Policy represents the agency to the media, industry stakeholders, elected officials and their staffs.  The Deputy Commissioner for Policy presents rule proposals and research updates to the TLC board of commissioners, periodically represents the Commissioner before the City Council, and oversees many of the industry’s key initiatives (currently including driver pay and anti-congestion policies).

"The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is the nation’s largest for-hire transportation agency, licensing and regulating the City’s yellow and green taxicabs, for-hire vehicles (including apps like Uber, Lyft, Via, and Juno), commuter vans, and luxury limousines. TLC develops and enforces rules to promote safety, transparency, as well as consumer and driver protection for a vital mode of transport in New York City. The vehicles, businesses, and drivers licensed and regulated by the agency move over one million people a day. With the introduction of new apps and technologies, TLC is on the front lines of a changing mobility landscape.  To learn more about the TLC, please visit: www.nyc.gov/taxi.
In May 2019, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a 45-day review of practices by brokers in the taxi industry. TLC-licensed brokers represent clients in the purchase or sale of a taxicab medallion. The review evaluated whether brokers violated existing TLC rules and recommended policy changes to identify and avoid potential broker conflicts and clarify brokers’ duty to act in the best interest of their clients.  TLC is expanding its capacity to conduct ongoing reviews of this nature by creating a new Business Practices Accountability Unit (BPAU).  The unit’s mission is to protect TLC drivers and medallion owners from unfair or misleading industry practices by TLC-licensed businesses.   Working in the Division of Finance and Administration, the BPAU Analysts will promote greater accountability and transparency of business practices in the for-hire transportation sector.  The Analysts will collaborate with agency partners to promote sound business practices, and investigate violations of TLC rules and relevant local, state or federal regulations.  Building upon the 45-day review of broker practices, the analysts will evaluate other TLC-licensed businesses and undertake a comprehensive review of existing TLC rules governing TLC-licensed business conduct to identify areas where new regulations are needed to protect drivers and medallion owners.  The analysts will work with other divisions within TLC, including licensing, prosecution and external affairs, on any necessary revisions to the licensure and renewal process, assisting in investigation of rule violations by TLC-licensed businesses, and educating drivers of their rights when working with a TLC-licensed business.    

Duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
• Design and conduct periodic, high-level reviews of business practices of TLC brokers and other business entities, such agents, fleets, high-volume for hire services, and technology service providers, to ensure compliance with TLC rules and relevant local, state, and federal regulations. 
• Develop investigative plans and strategies based on tips about bad behavior and analysis of complaints data, as well as random sampling.  Monitor companies suspected of engaging in suspicious practices.
• Serve as a subject matter expert in analyzing complex business practices, and analyze external factors impacting the financial stability of the industry (e.g., medallion lending practices).  Research the business practices of TLC licensed entities and evaluate risks to the industry.
• Conduct research and investigations involving examinations of records, interviews of subjects and witnesses, and on-site inspections, collaborating as needed with other agencies within the City.
• Collect, verify, and analyze documents subject to audit, including TLC data, financial records, public assistance records, and other records derived from law-enforcement databases and City and State agencies.  Conduct conflicts of interest reviews of annual disclosure reports.
• Carry out in-depth reviews that may be required as part of TLC licensing and renewal applications for businesses, as well as medallion transfers. 
• Assist in the development of an outreach plan to inform TLC drivers and owners of their rights, and to ensure that they know how to contact us and submit a formal complaint for investigation and possible prosecution if they feel they are seeing suspicious or predatory behavior.
• Analyze key metrics and develop best practices to guard against predatory lending.  Conduct surveys and analyses of licensee finances, such as medallion debt, as required by rule or law.
• Draft written reports and internal memoranda that concisely present findings and recommendations for appropriate action to be taken following investigations.  Prepare any annual or periodic reports required by statute or otherwise requested by TLC senior staff, City Hall, City Council, and other interested parties.
• Work in close coordination with other government investigative agencies.  Represent TLC at community meetings, outreach events, and public hearings. 
• Analyze and evaluate risks and controls relevant to TLC’s internal departments, policies and procedures.  Make recommendations to improve internal business practices.  
• Manage external audits conducted by local, state, and federal auditors.

In May 2019, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered a 45-day review of practices by brokers in the taxi industry. TLC-licensed brokers represent clients in the purchase or sale of a taxicab medallion. The review evaluated whether brokers violated existing TLC rules and recommended policy changes to identify and avoid potential broker conflicts and clarify brokers’ duty to act in the best interest of their clients.  TLC is expanding its capacity to conduct ongoing reviews of this nature by creating a new Business Practices Accountability Unit (BPAU).  The unit’s mission is to protect TLC drivers and medallion owners from unfair or misleading industry practices by TLC-licensed businesses.   Working in the Division of Finance and Administration, the BPAU Analysts will promote greater accountability and transparency of business practices in the for-hire transportation sector.  The Analysts will collaborate with agency partners to promote sound business practices, and investigate violations of TLC rules and relevant local, state or federal regulations.  Building upon the 45-day review of broker practices, the analysts will evaluate other TLC-licensed businesses and undertake a comprehensive review of existing TLC rules governing TLC-licensed business conduct to identify areas where new regulations are needed to protect drivers and medallion owners.  The analysts will work with other divisions within TLC, including licensing, prosecution and external affairs, on any necessary revisions to the licensure and renewal process, assisting in investigation of rule violations by TLC-licensed businesses, and educating drivers of their rights when working with a TLC-licensed business.    

Duties and responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
• Design and conduct periodic, high-level reviews of business practices of TLC brokers and other business entities, such agents, fleets, high-volume for hire services, and technology service providers, to ensure compliance with TLC rules and relevant local, state, and federal regulations. 
• Develop investigative plans and strategies based on tips about bad behavior and analysis of complaints data, as well as random sampling.  Monitor companies suspected of engaging in suspicious practices.
• Serve as a subject matter expert in analyzing complex business practices, and analyze external factors impacting the financial stability of the industry (e.g., medallion lending practices).  Research the business practices of TLC licensed entities and evaluate risks to the industry.
• Conduct research and investigations involving examinations of records, interviews of subjects and witnesses, and on-site inspections, collaborating as needed with other agencies within the City.
• Collect, verify, and analyze documents subject to audit, including TLC data, financial records, public assistance records, and other records derived from law-enforcement databases and City and State agencies.  Conduct conflicts of interest reviews of annual disclosure reports.
• Carry out in-depth reviews that may be required as part of TLC licensing and renewal applications for businesses, as well as medallion transfers. 
• Assist in the development of an outreach plan to inform TLC drivers and owners of their rights, and to ensure that they know how to contact us and submit a formal complaint for investigation and possible prosecution if they feel they are seeing suspicious or predatory behavior.
• Analyze key metrics and develop best practices to guard against predatory lending.  Conduct surveys and analyses of licensee finances, such as medallion debt, as required by rule or law.
• Draft written reports and internal memoranda that concisely present findings and recommendations for appropriate action to be taken following investigations.  Prepare any annual or periodic reports required by statute or otherwise requested by TLC senior staff, City Hall, City Council, and other interested parties.
